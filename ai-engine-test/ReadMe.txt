This is the test component for the Bot Libre AI engine.

This directory contains several test classes written in JUnit in Java.

The prebuild jar file is in /lib/botlibre-ai-test.jar

To build the source code the ant command line build tool is used.
You can download ant from, http://ant.apache.org/
To build run ant, or the build.bat file.

The project is developed in Eclipse.  There is an Eclipse .project file in the root directory.
You can download Eclipse from, https://eclipse.org/

This component also includes a standalone GUI that can be used for testing or to create and access a bot instance.
To run the GUI run "ant gui" or the gui.bat file.

The AI engine requires a PostgreSQL database.  The default user/password is postgres/password.
To change the user/password or database, edit the file, ai-engine/source/META-INF/persistence.xml.
You will need to rebuild the botlibre-ai.jar and copy it to the ai-engine-test lib directory.

To create and initialize the database run "ant initdb" or the initdb.bat file.

The Twitter, Facebook, and Freebase support also require developers keys from Twitter, Facebook, and Google.
