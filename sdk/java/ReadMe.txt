This directory includes the Bot Libre SDK for Java.

To use this in your own Java app, just copy the code and libraries to your own project structure.
You can either just use the SDKConnection or LiveChatConnection API.

The SDK only includes a Java client for Bot Libre, the server and AI engine are separate components.
